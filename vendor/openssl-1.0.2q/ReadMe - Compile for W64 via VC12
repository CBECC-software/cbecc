Steps performed to compile for Win64 via VC12 (Visual Studio 2013)

Read through Install.W64 - the following is an excerpt --

(1) Downloaded & installed ActiveState Perl from:
		http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl  (ver 5.26.3, build 2603)
		added perl path to PATH env (C:\Perl64\bin) (via Perl installer)

(2) from a std command prompt, run (from C:\dev\CBECC-dev\vendor\openssl-1.0.2q):
   > perl Configure VC-WIN64A
   > ms\do_ms

(3) from the Visual Studio 2013 Command Prompt (and from C:\WSF\devLibs\CompMgr\src\OpenSSL\openssl-1.0.1j):
	> nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak
			- nmake failed - but include directory setup fine

Steps NOT performed:
 	> cd out32dll
 	> ..\ms\test
