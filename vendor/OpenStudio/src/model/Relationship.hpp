/** Relationship describes relationships that a ModelObject may have with other \link ModelObject ModelObjects \endlink.
 *
 *  Relationships of a ModelObject are similar to Attributes of a ModelObject, they provide named access to object methods
 *  through the QObject Q_PROPERTY system.  However, while Attributes of a ModelObject return simple data types (e.g. PlanarSurface
 *  has an Attribute named 'netArea' that returns a double), Relationships return related ModelObjects.  A Relationship is constructed
 *  with a primary ModelObject and describes relationships that the primary ModelObject may have with other ModelObjects. A Relationship
 *  can be singular (e.g. a Surface object relates to 0 or 1 Construction objects) or plural (e.g. a Zone relates to any number of Lights objects).
 *  A Relationship object can be used to get these related ModelObjects by name.
