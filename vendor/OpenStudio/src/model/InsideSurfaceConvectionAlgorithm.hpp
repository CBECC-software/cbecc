/** InsideSurfaceConvectionAlgorithm derives from ModelObject and is an interface to the OpenStudio IDD object named "SurfaceConvectionAlgorithm:Inside".
 *
 *  InsideSurfaceConvectionAlgorithm is a unique object that specifies the global model used for surface convection at the inside face of all the 
 *  heat transfer surfaces in the model.  This global algorithm may be overridden for specific Surface, SurfaceList, or Zone objects. 
 *  InsideSurfaceConvectionAlgorithm does not have a public constructor because it is a unique ModelObject.
