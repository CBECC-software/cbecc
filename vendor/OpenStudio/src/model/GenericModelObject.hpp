/** GenericModelObject derives from ModelObject and is a generic interface to any OpenStudio IDD object..
 *
 *  GenericModelObject is different from all other \link ModelObject ModelObjects \endlink in that
 *  it does not wrap a specific OpenStudio IDD object.  Instead it is a generic wrapper that can hold
 *  OpenStudio IDD objects of any type.  When objects are added to Model, a large switch statement is
 *  used to construct wrappers of the correct type for each new object.  If the type of a newly added
 *  object has not yet been wrapped by a specific ModelObject then a GenericModelObject is used to hold 
 *  a reference to the data.  GenericModelObject is planned to be deprecated once all OpenStudio IDD types
 *  are wrapped by specific \link ModelObject ModelObjects \endlink, this class only exists in the interim
 *  so translation to and from EnergyPlus via the implicit translator does not lose data objects.
