/** WorkspaceWatcher watches a Workspace for signals emitted on changes.  This signals will cause the 
 *  watcher to mark the Workspace  as dirty.  The dirty flag will persist until reset by the user.  A virtual
 *  method onChangeWorkspace is also available to override, it is called everytime the Workspace changes. The 
 *  virtual method onBecomeDirty is called only after dirty transitions from false to true.  Alternatively, the 
 *  virtual method onBecomeClean is called only after dirty transitions from true to false.
 *
 *  WorkspaceWatcher an atypical QObject because it is designed to be stack allocated.  In many cases it 
 *  would be preferred to connect your own heap allocated QObject to the Workspace signals directly rather
 *  than using this convenience class.
