/** IdfObjectWatcher watches an IdfObject for signals emitted on changes.  These signals will cause 
 *  the watcher to mark the IdfObject as dirty.  The dirty flag will persist until reset by the 
 *  user.  Virtual methods onChangeIdfObject and onDataFieldChange are also available to override. 
 *  The former is called every time the IdfObject changes in any way; the latter is called whenever 
 *  a data field changes (not triggered by comment changes, and is superceded by 
 *  onRelationshipChange for WorkspaceObject pointer fields.) The virtual method onBecomeDirty is 
 *  called only after dirty transitions from false to true.  Alternatively, the virtual method 
 *  onBecomeClean is called only after dirty transitions from true to false.
 *
 *  IdfObjectWatcher is an atypical QObject because it is designed to be stack allocated.  In many 
 *  cases it would be preferred to connect your own heap allocated QObject to the Workspace signals 
 *  directly rather than using this convenience class. **/
