Though not posted as an open source product until 2016, this work began with the award of a PNNL contract back in 1994 to develop COMcheck-Plus, an ancestor of the CBECC tools.  

The most recent thanks go out to the California Energy Commission, and in particular Martha Brook, who had the vision and perseverance to bring this to fruition and Scott Criswell (Wrightsoft) who lead its development from the first proposal back in '94 to today and Bill Wright (Wrightsoft) for committing resources to this effort.
