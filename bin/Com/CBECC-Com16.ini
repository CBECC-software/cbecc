;        security is disabled
;    3 - prompt user when report generation is not available / continue analysis without 
;        prompting user if report security is disabled
;    4 - abort analysis with no user prompt if report generation is not available / prompt
;        user if report security is disabled

; QuickAnalysis substitutes four seasonal single week simulations for full annual simulations,
; thereby significantly reducing simulation runtimes.
; For more info: http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-19961.pdf

;   SET TO 0 for release version to prevent excessively long project log files.
VerboseInputLogging=0

; LogRuleEvaluation - controls same rule evaluation logging as described above, but for rules
