\pard\f0\fs18 If the roof cannot accommodate the standard design PV size, the required PV can be reduced to the maximum PV system size that can be installed on the building’s Solar Access Roof Area (SARA). SARA includes the unshaded area of the building’s roof space capable of structurally supporting a PV system, and the area of all roof space on covered parking areas, carports, and all other newly constructed structures on the site that are compatible with supporting a PV system. Refer to Section 150.1(c)14 for more information.\par
