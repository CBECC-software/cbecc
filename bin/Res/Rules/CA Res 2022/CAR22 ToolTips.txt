Proj:SolAccessRfArea, "SARA includes the area of the building’s roof space capable of structurally supporting a PV system, and the
area of all roof space on covered parking areas, carports, and all other newly constructed structures on the
site that are compatible with supporting a PV system per Title 24, Part 2, Section 1511.2.
SARA does NOT include:
i. Any roof area that has less than 70 percent annual solar access. Annual solar access is determined by
dividing the total annual solar insolation, accounting for shading obstructions, by the total annual solar
insolation if the same areas were unshaded by obstructions.
ii. Occupied roof areas as specified by CBC Section 503.1.4.
iii. Roof area that is otherwise not available due to compliance with other building code requirements.
Exception 1: For steep slope roofs, SARA shall not consider roof areas with a northerly azimuth that
lies between 300 degrees and 90 degrees from true north.
Refer to standards section 150.1(c)14 for more details"
